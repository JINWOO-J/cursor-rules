# JavaScript & React Style

- Use ES Modules (`import`/`export`).
- Prefer function components and React Hooks; avoid class components.
- Semicolons required; 2-space indent; single quotes; trailing commas where valid.
- Named exports preferred; default export only when a file exposes a single main thing.
- File naming: `PascalCase.jsx` for components, `kebab-case.js` for utilities.
- Organize imports: 1) node/externals, 2) workspace modules, 3) relative paths. Keep groups separated by a blank line.
- Components
  - Keep components pure; derive UI from props/state.
  - Side effects in `useEffect`; memoize heavy calculations with `useMemo` and event handlers with `useCallback` when profiling indicates value.
  - Event handlers named `handleX` (e.g., `handleSubmit`).
  - Co-locate lightweight helpers and styles with the component file.
- Public APIs (utilities/components) should include minimal JSDoc for params/returns.
- Example component: [sample-react-component.js](mdc:sample-react-component.js)
