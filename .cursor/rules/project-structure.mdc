# Project Structure

- Primary docs: [README.md](mdc:README.md), [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](mdc:CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Build tasks: [Makefile](mdc:Makefile)
- Sample component: [sample-react-component.js](mdc:sample-react-component.js)
- Container example: [sample.Dockerfile](mdc:sample.Dockerfile)

Guidelines

- Keep example source files at the repository root for simplicity; production code should live under a future `src/` directory with domain-driven subfolders (e.g., `components/`, `lib/`, `api/`).
- Store project documentation in the `docs/` directory. High-level product details are in [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md).
- Prefer descriptive filenames. Co-locate small helpers with their primary consumer; extract to `lib/` when shared.
- Use `README.md` to describe how to run, build, and contribute.
