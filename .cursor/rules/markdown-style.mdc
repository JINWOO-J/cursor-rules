# Markdown Style

- Use ATX headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) in proper order; one `#` title per file.
- Keep lines concise; wrap around 100 characters when practical.
- Use code ticks for files, functions, and commands (e.g., `Makefile`, `npm run dev`).
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags (e.g., ```bash, ```javascript) and minimal comments.
- Prefer relative links with descriptive anchor text; avoid bare URLs.
- Tables only when they add clarity; otherwise prefer short bullet lists.
- Be concise and task-oriented; place additional context after the main instruction.
- Dates/times: ISO format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` (Asia/Seoul).
