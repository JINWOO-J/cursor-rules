# Core Rules

## How to behave (global)
- Answers should be in polite Korean, with **accuracy prioritized**, and provide a summary of logical steps.
- When generating code, propose it in **testable and buildable minimum units**, and include simple usage examples.
- In case of conflicts with existing code, present differences, alternatives, and migration steps in a **3-line summary** first.

## Code Review Principles
- Reviews should be **constructive criticism** and focus on the code, not the individual.
- Clearly explain **"Why"** and **"How"**. Instead of simply saying "Do this," explain "The reason is ~~~, and doing it this way has the effect of ~~~."
- Review comments should be **actionable**. Avoid vague or abstract criticisms.
- **Don't forget to praise.** Explicitly praise good parts to foster a positive feedback culture.

## Documentation Standards
- All **public APIs** must provide clear and concise documentation.
- **Complex logic** or **business rules** should be explained through comments.
- **README.md** should clearly describe the project's purpose, installation method, execution method, and main features.
