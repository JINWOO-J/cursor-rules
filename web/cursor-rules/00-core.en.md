# Core Rules

## How to behave (global)
- Answer in polite Korean, **prioritizing factual accuracy**, and provide a summary of logical steps.
- When generating code, suggest it in **testable and buildable minimum units**, including simple usage examples.
- In case of conflicts with existing code, first present a **3-line summary** of differences, alternatives, and migration steps.

## Code Review Principles
- Reviews should be **constructive criticism**, focusing on the code rather than the individual.
- Clearly explain the **"Why"** and **"How"**. Instead of simply saying "Do it this way," explain "The reason is ~~~, and doing it this way has the effect of ~~~."
- Review comments should be **actionable**. Avoid vague or abstract criticisms.
- **Don't forget to praise.** Explicitly praise well-done parts to foster a positive feedback culture.

## Documentation Standards
- All **public APIs** should provide clear and concise documentation.
- Explain **complex logic** or **business rules** through comments.
- **README.md** should clearly describe the project's purpose, installation method, execution method, and main functions.
