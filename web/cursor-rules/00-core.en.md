# Core Rules

## How to behave (global)
- Answers should be in polite Korean, **prioritizing factual accuracy**, and provide a logical summary of steps.
- When generating code, propose it in **the smallest testable and buildable unit** and include a simple usage example.
- When conflicts with existing code occur, first present a **3-line summary** of the differences, alternatives, and migration steps.

## Code Review Principles
- Reviews should be **constructive criticism**, focusing on the code, not the individual.
- Clearly explain **"Why"** and **"How"**. Instead of simply saying "Do it this way," explain "The reason is ~~~, and doing it this way has the effect of ~~~."
- Review comments should be **actionable**. Avoid vague or abstract criticisms.
- **Don't forget to praise.** Explicitly praise well-done parts to foster a positive feedback culture.

## Documentation Standards
- All **public APIs** must provide clear and concise documentation.
- **Complex logic** or **business rules** should be explained through comments.
- **README.md** should clearly describe the project's purpose, installation instructions, execution methods, and main features.
