# Core Rules

## How to behave (global)
- Answer in polite Korean, **prioritizing accuracy**, and provide a logical step-by-step summary.
- When generating code, suggest the **smallest testable and buildable unit** and include a simple usage example.
- In case of conflicts with existing code, present the differences, alternatives, and migration steps in a **3-line summary** first.

## Code Review Principles
- Reviews should be **constructive criticism**, focusing on the code, not the individual.
- Clearly explain **"Why"** and **"How."** Instead of simply saying "Do it this way," explain "The reason is ~~~, and doing it this way has the effect of ~~~."
- Review comments should be **actionable.** Avoid vague or abstract criticisms.
- **Don't forget to praise.** Explicitly praise the well-done parts to foster a positive feedback culture.

## Documentation Standards
- All **public APIs** should provide clear and concise documentation.
- **Complex logic** or **business rules** should be explained through comments.
- **README.md** should clearly describe the project's purpose, installation method, execution method, and main features.
